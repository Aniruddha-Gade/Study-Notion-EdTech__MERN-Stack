## System Architecture 🏰
<br/>
☝ The StudyNotion ed-tech platform consists of three main components:  <br/>
The front end, the back end, and the database. The platform follows a client-server architecture, with the front end serving as the client and the back end and database serving as the server.

🎨 Front-end  <br/>
The front end of the platform is built using ReactJS, which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ReactJS allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces also **Loading Skeleton**, which are critical for providing an engaging learning experience to the students. The front end communicates with the back end using RESTful API calls.

⚙️ Back-end  <br/>
The back end of the platform is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS, which are popular frameworks for building scalable and robust server-side applications. The back end provides APIs for the front end to consume, which include functionalities such as user authentication, course creation, and course consumption. The back end also handles the logic for processing and storing the course content and user data.

🛢️ Database  <br/>
The database for the platform is built using MongoDB, which is a NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable data storage solution. MongoDB allows for the storage of unstructured and semi-structured data, which is useful for storing course content such as videos, images, and PDFs. The database stores the course content, user data, and other relevant information related to the platform.

- **Markdown Formatting ✍️:** Course content in document format is stored in Markdown format, allowing for easier display and rendering on the front-end.



#### Data Models and Database Schema

The back-end of StudyNotion uses several data models and database schemas to manage data, including:

- **Student Schema 🧑‍🎓:** Includes fields such as name, email, password, and course details for each student.
- **Instructor Schema 👩‍🏫:** Includes fields such as name, email, password, and course details for each instructor.
- **Course Schema 📚:** Includes fields such as course name, description, instructor details, and media content.


### Database 🛢️
